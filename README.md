*Previously Watermark Bucket Uploader. Existing installations and settings continue to work normally.*

</div>

A zero-friction image uploader for Obsidian with S3-compatible storage, WebP conversion, compression, and optional watermarks. This plugin intercepts every paste and drop, optimizes the image, uploads it to your own S3-compatible bucket, and drops a clean `![](url)` right into your note. Your images, your infrastructure.

## Why Paste to S3

- **Paste and keep writing** — paste or drag an image and it's already in your bucket. No menus, no dialogs.
- **Your storage, not someone else's service** — works with any S3-compatible bucket you already own and control. Bring your own storage.
- **Smaller files, faster pages** — automatic WebP conversion and compression keep your storage lean and your site fast.
- **Optional watermarking** — overlay custom text or a logo when you want one, with font, size, color, opacity, position, and a live preview. Watermarking can be disabled entirely.
- **Works with any S3-compatible storage** — Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2, and more.
- **Keeps your private notes private** — glob-based ignore patterns let you exclude specific folders from ever being uploaded.
- **Not just images** — optionally upload video, audio, and PDFs the same way.

## Installation

### From Community Plugins (recommended)
1. Open **Settings → Community plugins** and turn off restricted mode.
2. Click **Browse**, search for **Paste to S3**, click **Install**, then **Enable**.

### Manual
1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/firstsun-dev/watermark-bucket-uploader/releases/latest).
2. Create `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/watermark-bucket-uploader/`.
3. Copy the three files into that folder.
4. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin under **Settings → Community plugins**.

## Quick start

1. Install **Paste to S3**.
2. Open **Settings → Paste to S3** and fill in your S3-compatible storage credentials (see [Storage](#storage)).
3. Set your public image URL.
4. Paste or drag an image into any note — it's optimized, uploaded, and a `![](url)` link is inserted automatically.

Optional: configure compression, WebP, watermarking, upload-on-drag, and folder exclusions. For a step-by-step walkthrough on setting up Cloudflare R2 and configuring watermarks, see the [Cloudflare R2 & Watermarks Setup Guide](docs/how-to-setup-r2-and-watermarks.md).

## Configuration

### Storage

Bring your own storage. Paste to S3 works with any S3-compatible provider — AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Backblaze B2, or any other S3-compatible endpoint.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Access Key | S3 / R2 access key ID |
| Secret Key | S3 / R2 secret access key (stored securely in local storage) |
| Region | Bucket region (`auto` for Cloudflare R2) |
| S3 Bucket | Your bucket name |
| Bucket Folder | Optional path prefix — supports `${year}`, `${month}`, `${day}`, `${basename}` |
| Custom Endpoint | Required for R2 and non-AWS providers |
| Custom Image URL | Public URL base, e.g. your CDN or custom domain |

#### Cloudflare R2 quick setup

1. Create a bucket in the R2 dashboard.
2. Generate an API token with **Object Read & Write** permissions.
3. Set **Custom Endpoint** to `https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`.
4. Set **Region** to `auto`.
5. Set **Custom Image URL** to your public bucket domain.

### Watermark (optional)

Watermarking is off by default and can be disabled entirely — skip this section if you don't need it. When enabled, open the **Live Preview** in settings to see changes in real time.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Text Watermark** | Toggle text overlay |
| Text | e.g. `© yourdomain.com` |
| Font / Size / Style / Color | Full typography control; size `0` = auto (2% of image width) |
| **Logo Watermark** | Toggle image overlay |
| Logo Path | Vault-relative path, e.g. `_assets/logo.png` |
| Logo Size / Opacity | Scale (% of image width) and transparency (0–1) |
| Position | Bottom Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Center, or Center |
| Offset X/Y | Fine-tune placement (±% of image dimensions) |
| Preview Res | Canvas resolution for preview accuracy (720p–4K) |

## Daily workflow

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl/Cmd+V` in any note | Intercepts the image, processes it, uploads, inserts `![](url)` |
| Drag & drop onto the editor | Same pipeline (enable "Upload on drag" in settings) |
| Command Palette → `Upload image` | Pick a local file to upload manually |
| Auto-upload on create | Any image added to your vault is uploaded and removed locally |

## Privacy and security

- **Local storage** — bucket credentials are stored locally in the plugin's data folder inside your vault, and are only ever sent to the storage endpoint you configured.
- **No telemetry** — the plugin collects no usage data or analytics.

## Requirements

- Obsidian **1.6.6** or later
- Desktop and mobile supported

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firstsun-dev/watermark-bucket-uploader.git
npm install

npm run dev    # watch build
npm run build  # type-check + production build
npm run test   # vitest suite
npm run lint   # eslint
```
